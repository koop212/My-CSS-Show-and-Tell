# My-CSS-Show-and-Tell
I did a research on Responsive Web Design-Media Queries.  You would use @media rule. I did my design as a desktop site first, but it is recommended to design for a mobile site first.  There's a useful tool called device toolbar that is located in the upper left hand corner of the chrome devtools.  It will tell you the width and height sizes and displays your design for all devices.  

Here's a helpful link about using media queries, https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp.
